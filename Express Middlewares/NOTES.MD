# Express Middleware Functions

An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

## An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

1. **Application-level middleware**: Application-level middleware is bound to an instance of the Express application and is used to perform tasks at the application level. It can be used for tasks like logging, setting headers, and authentication checks.

2. **Router-level middleware**: Router-level middleware is similar to application-level middleware, but it is bound to a specific router within the Express application. This allows you to apply middleware to specific routes or groups of routes.

3. **Error-handling middleware**: Error-handling middleware is used to handle errors that occur during the request-response cycle. It is defined with four parameters (err, req, res, next) and is typically used to catch and process errors.

4. **Built-in middleware**: Express comes with built-in middleware functions that provide common functionality, such as parsing request bodies, serving static files, and handling cookies. These middleware functions can be used by simply requiring and configuring them.

5. **Third-party middleware**: Third-party middleware are middleware functions created by the community or third-party developers. These can be added to your Express application to add various functionalities like authentication, validation, and more.
