# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern is a widely used architectural design pattern in software development. It helps in organizing and separating an application's components to achieve modularity and maintainability.

## Components of MVC

### 1. Model
The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing data, processing requests, and ensuring data consistency. In an MVC application, the Model is typically independent of both the View and Controller.

#### Responsibilities of the Model:
- Retrieve and store data from and to a database or other data sources.
- Implement business rules and logic.
- Notify the View and Controller about changes in the data.

### 2. View
The View represents the user interface (UI) of the application. It is responsible for presenting data to the user and receiving user input. In MVC, the View is passive and only displays information; it does not handle data manipulation or business logic.

#### Responsibilities of the View:
- Display data to the user in a user-friendly format.
- Present information based on the state of the Model.
- Send user input events to the Controller for processing.

### 3. Controller
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to perform necessary actions, and updates the View accordingly. Controllers are responsible for handling user interactions and managing the flow of the application.

#### Responsibilities of the Controller:
- Receive user input from the View.
- Interpret and validate user input.
- Invoke appropriate methods on the Model to update data.
- Update the View to reflect changes in the Model.

## Advantages of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC enforces a clear separation between the Model, View, and Controller, making the application easier to maintain and modify.
- **Modularity**: Each component can be developed independently, allowing for code reusability and easier testing.
- **Parallel Development**: Different teams or developers can work on each component simultaneously.
- **Flexibility**: Changes to one component (e.g., updating the UI) can be made without affecting the others.

MVC is a versatile pattern and can be applied to various types of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, and mobile apps, making it a valuable tool for building robust and maintainable software systems.
