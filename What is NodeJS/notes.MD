# What is Node.js

Node.js is neither a JavaScript framework nor a library. It is a JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. JavaScript is a language primarily designed for adding interactivity to webpages. In the earlier days, JavaScript was confined to web browsers, primarily because most browsers included a built-in JavaScript engine. This variability in engines sometimes caused JavaScript to behave differently on different webpages.

## The Birth of Node.js

Enter the engineer, **Ryan Dahl**, who pondered the possibility of running JavaScript outside of web browsers. His ingenious idea was to embed the V8 engine (an open-source JavaScript engine used in Chrome) with C++ to create a runtime environment capable of executing JavaScript beyond the browser environment.

## The Power of Node.js

This innovation allowed JavaScript to communicate with the native machine, thanks to its integration with C++. As a result, developers could create web servers and other server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js became a versatile choice, serving both frontend and backend development needs.

## Installation of Node.js

To get started with Node.js, follow these installation steps:

1. **Download Node.js**: Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the version of Node.js that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Node.js**: Run the installer you downloaded and follow the installation instructions. Node.js also includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is essential for managing packages and dependencies.

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
## Node.js Versioning and Long Term Support (LTS)

Node.js follows a versioning pattern with a unique feature:

- Versions that start with an even number (e.g., 14.x, 16.x) indicate they are built for Long Term Support (LTS). LTS versions are stable and recommended for building production applications.

- Versions that start with an odd number (e.g., 15.x, 17.x) contain new features that are currently in the testing phase. These versions are best used for testing new features and may contain certain types of bugs.

If a version contains LTS, it stands for Long Term Support, indicating its suitability for building stable, production-ready applications.

**Note**: When choosing a Node.js version for your project, consider your requirements and whether you need the stability of an LTS version or want to experiment with new features in an odd-numbered release.

**Note**: For more detailed information on Node.js versioning and releases, please refer to the [official Node.js release documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
