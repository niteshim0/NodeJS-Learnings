# What is Node.js

Node.js is neither a JavaScript framework nor a library. It is a JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. JavaScript is a language primarily designed for adding interactivity to webpages. In the earlier days, JavaScript was confined to web browsers, primarily because most browsers included a built-in JavaScript engine. This variability in engines sometimes caused JavaScript to behave differently on different webpages.

## The Birth of Node.js

Enter the engineer, **Ryan Dahl**, who pondered the possibility of running JavaScript outside of web browsers. His ingenious idea was to embed the V8 engine (an open-source JavaScript engine used in Chrome) with C++ to create a runtime environment capable of executing JavaScript beyond the browser environment.

## The Power of Node.js

This innovation allowed JavaScript to communicate with the native machine, thanks to its integration with C++. As a result, developers could create web servers and other server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js became a versatile choice, serving both frontend and backend development needs.

In summary, Node.js opened up a world of possibilities for JavaScript developers, enabling them to write server-side code and build robust web applications beyond the confines of the browser.
