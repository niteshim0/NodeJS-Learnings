<h3>What is NodeJS</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is neither a JS Framework nor a library<li>
<li>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine</li>
<li>JavaScript is a language which is essentially created for the interactivity on webpage</li>
<li>In earlier days,JavaScript was used to run only on Web Browsers</li>
<li>Why because they all have built-in JavaScript Engine ,it is one of the reasons, JavaScript sometimes may behave differently on different webpages.</li>
<li>There comes an engineer named <i>Ryan Dahl<i> who thought how one can run JavaScript outside of the browser</li>
<li>He comes up with idea to embedd V8(Chrome JS Engine which is Open Source) with C++ to create a runtime enviroment which is capable of running JS outside of browser as well</li>
<li>Now,JS can talk to native machine because of C++</li>
<li>One can create webservers in JavaScript Languages,it can be used in backend alongwith frontend</li>
